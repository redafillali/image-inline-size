This plugin improves CLS by adding inline styles to lazy-loaded images.

== Description ==

The Image Inline Size plugin automatically adds width and height styles inline to your images in post content. This improves the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) by providing dimensions for images before they have loaded.

This is particularly useful for lazy-loaded images, as it helps to prevent the layout from shifting as images load.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `image-inline-size` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the Image Inline Size plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
